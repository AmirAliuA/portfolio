Recently, I decided to play through [Silent Hill 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_(video_game)) using the PS1 emulator [DuckStation](https://duckstation.org/). Having just finished playing the [Silent Hill 2 remake](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/), I was curious to see how the original entry in the series stacked up. I've always been intrigued by the legacy of the Silent Hill series, but as someone who missed the boat back when it first launched in 1999 (I was born in 2003, haha), I wasn't sure what to expect. Would the game hold up after nearly 25 years? Would its outdated graphics and clunky mechanics ruin the experience? Spoiler: <ins>IT DIDN'T</ins>.

### A Story That Pulls You In
From the moment you step into the foggy streets of Silent Hill as Harry Mason, the game grabs you with its eerie atmosphere and refuses to let go. Harry's search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, is the kind of simple yet gripping settup that works because it's relatable. You're not some super soldier or chosen one -- you're just a regular guy caught in a nightmare. The story is full of twists, weird cult, and makes you question what's real and what isn't. Sure, some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but that almost adds to its charm.

### Atmosphere Over Graphics
Let's address the elephant in the room: yes, Silent Hill 1 is old. Yes, the graphics didn't age well -- the game released in 1998. But the genius of this game lies in how it uses its limitations to its advantage. The thick fog and grainy visuals don't just hide the PS1's hardware limitations -- they create an oppressive atmosphere that's unmatched by any other game.

The sound design deserves it's own blog post to be honest. What Akira Yamaoka managed to accomplish is BEAUTIFUL. The industrial screeches and melancholic melodies stay with you long after you've put down the controller. And then there's the silence  -- the way the game uses quiet moments to build tension is nothing short of masterful. Every creak, every distant scream, every echo of your footsteps... it all works together to keep you on edge.

### Gameplay: Imperfect but Effective
Let's be real: the very first thing you will notice when booting the game are the controls. They're janky to say the least. I switched the control type from 3D to 2D almost immediately, which made movement a lot more intuitive. Combat is more about survival than skill, which makes every encounter feel meaningful. However, the melee weapons and some ranged attack weapons have frustratingly short reach, leading to moments where you'll swing at an enemy or fire off a shot and completely miss. This can make fights more tense, but it also highlights the clunky mechanics. Running out of ammo or health supplies can leave you genuinely panicked, and that's exactly what survival horror is supposed to do.

The puzzles, on the other hand, are hit or miss. Some are brilliant and rewarding, while others feel like -- huh? Still, they're a core part of the experience, and there's something satisfying about finally cracking a riddle.

My favourite part of Silent Hill games is completely marking the map -- where the roads cut off, open/closed doors. There's something satisfying about it.

### Why It Still Matters
Playing Silent Hill 1 in 2025 isn't just about nostalgia; it's about experiencing the roots of a genre that shaped countless games since. It's a reminder that great games don't need cutting-edge-graphics or hyper-polished mechanics -- they need atmosphere, story. and heart. This game nails all three.

If you've never played Silent Hill 1 and you're a fan of horror, do yourself a favor and try it. I'd recommend emulating it or borrow a friend's copy for the PS1 if they have one laying around. Konami no longer sells the game, and online shopping platforms sell the game for crazy amount of money.

Find yourself a PS1 BIOS file online and you're good to go. :)

### Final Thoughts
I went into Silent Hill 1 expecting a relic of gaming history, and I came out with a newfound appreciation for what survival horror can achieve. The game might show its age in places, but it's a masterpiece in atmosphere and storytelling. Playing it felt like uncovering a hidden gem, even if the gem's edges are a little rough. 

Now excuse me while I play the rest of the Silent Hill games.
