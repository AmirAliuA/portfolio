Iâ€™ve always been a fan of simplicity when it comes to your own personal website and not throw rainbow themed buttons, 50 different
gradient combinations, 1200px height * width picture of yourself or your favorite show character.

So yeah, I removed the old website and will be using this one for now. Why not.
