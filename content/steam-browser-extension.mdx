### What is this & why I made this extension
As a gamer from Kosovo, Steam has been my go-to platform for years. But there's a small yet meaningful detail
that's been missing for far too long: the Kosovo flag on community profiles. It might seem like a minor issue,
something that wouldn't matter to most. But for those of us from Kosovo, it's about representation. Over the
years, many of us have made requests, raised awareness, and voiced our frustrations -- but the flag still isn't there.

So I did it on my own. With a simple browser extension, I created a solution that automatically replaces the missing Kosovo flag
on Steam profiles with the correct one.

I love what Valve has built so far, but adding the Kosovo flag? That's something you can fix in seconds, and it would mean a lot to so many of us.

Please, it's a small change for you -- but a big one for us.
